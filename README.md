# 🏠 Home Security System Manager

## 🌟 Overview

The **Home Security System Manager** is a mobile application developed in Java for Android, enhanced with Arduino-based hardware simulations. This project provides a centralized platform for users to manage and set up home security systems, offering both software and hardware integration for a complete smart home experience. By adhering to the Command Design Pattern and SOLID principles, the app ensures modularity, scalability, and ease of use.

## ✨ Features

### Supported Security Systems
- 🔒 **Door Locks**: Lock, unlock, and set PINs remotely.
- 💡 **Lights**: Control lights with on/off functionality and timers for security simulation.
- 📹 **Cameras**: Monitor live feeds remotely.
- 🚨 **Alarms**: Activate/deactivate and adjust volume remotely.
- 🔊 **Speakers**: Communicate with visitors at the door.
- 🕵️ **Motion Detectors**: Receive real-time notifications for detected motion.

### Key Functionalities
- Centralized control for multiple security systems.
- Remote setup and management through an intuitive GUI.
- Notifications and alerts for enhanced security.
- Arduino integration for hardware simulation of app-controlled devices.

## 🤖 Arduino Integration

The app is paired with Arduino hardware to simulate real-world interactions. It controls:
- 🔒 Door lock mechanisms using servos.
- 💡 Light systems using LEDs.
- 🕵️ Motion detection using PIR sensors.
- 🚨 Alarm systems using buzzers.

Arduino connects with Firebase to synchronize app commands and hardware responses in real time.

### 🛠️ How It Works
1. The app sends user commands to Firebase.
2. The Arduino reads commands from Firebase and performs the requested action.
3. Actions include turning on/off devices, setting timers, or sending motion alerts.

### 🛠️ Design: Class Diagram

Here is the class diagram illustrating the structure and relationships within the application:

1. **Command Design Pattern**:
   - `Command` Interface: Defines the methods `executeOn()`, `executeOff()`, and `executeSetup()`.
   - Concrete Command Classes:
     - `DoorLockCommand`
     - `LightCommand`
     - `CameraCommand`
     - `AlarmCommand`
     - `SpeakerCommand`
     - `MotionDetectorCommand`
   - Receiver Classes:
     - `DoorLock`
     - `Light`
     - `Camera`
     - `Alarm`
     - `Speaker`
     - `MotionDetector`
   - `Remote` Class: Invokes methods from the command objects.
